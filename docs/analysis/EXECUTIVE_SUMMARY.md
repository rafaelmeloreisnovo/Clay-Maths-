## What is RAFAELIA?

RAFAELIA (Relativity Living Light) is an **interdisciplinary research framework** that bridges:
- **Mathematics** (Clay Millennium Problems)
- **Cosmology** (Dark energy, expansion, structure formation)
- **Computation** (Adaptive algorithms, clustering, optimization)
- **Philosophy** (Symbolic systems, emergence, symbiosis)

**Core Concept:** The universe operates through multiple simultaneous mechanisms (tri-gravity), exhibits wave-particle-like duality at cosmic scales (photonic superposition), and can be modeled through adaptive learning algorithms (cluster feeding).

## Clay Mathematics Problems Connections

### Summary of Connections

| Problem | Connection Strength | Contribution Level | Research Value |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **P vs NP** | Medium | 10% (Heuristic) | Medium-High |
| **Navier-Stokes** | Medium | 20% (Analogical) | Medium |
| **Riemann Hypothesis** | Medium-High | 25% (Statistical) | Medium |
| **Yang-Mills** | Low-Medium | 15% (Phenomenological) | Low-Medium |
| **BSD Conjecture** | Low | 10% (Inspirational) | Low |
| **Hodge Conjecture** | Medium | 20% (Computational) | Medium |
| **Poincaré** | Medium | 30% (Methodological) | Medium |

**Interpretation:**
- Connections are **heuristic and analogical**, not rigorous proofs
- Provide **novel perspectives** and **computational test beds**
- **Research value** in exploring connections, not solving problems
- Most promising: **Riemann Hypothesis** (spectral theory), **P vs NP** (complexity)
